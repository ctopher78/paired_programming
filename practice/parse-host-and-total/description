Sample Input 0

hosts_access_log_00.txt
Sample Output 0

Given filename = "hosts_access_log_00.txt", we process the records in hosts_access_log_00.txt and create an output file named records_hosts_access_log_00.txt containing the following rows:

burger.letters.com 3
d104.aa.net 3
unicomp6.unicomp.net 4
