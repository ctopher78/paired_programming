Problem 1:
given a string, find the top source addresses being blocked by acls and print the source ip, the total packets, and the total bytes.

example:
1.1.1.1 10 4500


Problem 2
given a string, sort the top source addresses, by number of packats, being blocked by acls and print the source ip, the total packets, and the total bytes.

example:
1.1.1.1 10 4500
2.2.2.2 9 5000
3.3.3.3 4 3500

SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP

regex = `.*denied \w+ ([0-9.]).*, (\d+) packet (\d+)`
